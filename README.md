## Important Before You Merge
* ### Please `pull` first every time before you want to make some changes by running `git pull` in order to keep your project files up to date

* ### If you want to try something new that you are not sure if it works, you can start a new branch and commit your changes on that branch instead of the master branch.
  * #### To create a new branch, run `git branch <YOUR BRANCH NAME>`
  * #### To switch to the branch, run `git checkout <YOUR BRANCH NAME>`

* ### Please fix any conflicts before push to Github
